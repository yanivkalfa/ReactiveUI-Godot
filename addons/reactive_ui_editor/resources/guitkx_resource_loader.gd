class_name GuitkxResourceLoader
extends ResourceFormatLoader
## Loads a .guitkx file as a GuitkxResource so double-clicking it in the FileSystem dock routes to
## the reactive_ui_editor main screen (via EditorNode's ResourceLoader.exists() -> _handles/_edit path).
##
## MUST have a class_name. The engine removes ALL custom format loaders on every script-reload
## cycle (which the reactive_ui watcher triggers on each save, by regenerating a .gd) and re-adds
## ONLY the ones declared as global classes. The previous manually-registered, class_name-less
## instance silently died on the first reload after boot — .guitkx loads then failed, the dock
## cached the failure (red ✕), routing fell through, and with no textfile fallback the files went
## invisible [field captures across three sessions]. With class_name the engine owns registration
## and re-adds this loader after every reload; the `open_guitkx_in_editor` toggle now lives in the
## plugin's _handles() instead of loader add/remove.
