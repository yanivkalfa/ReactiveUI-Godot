class_name RUISignals
extends RefCounted
## Process-wide string-keyed shared signal registry (Phase 7.1). Mirrors ReactiveUIToolKit's signal
## factory: `get_or_create(key, initial)` lazily creates ONE shared RUISignal per key, so any
## component anywhere in the tree (or across scenes) that reads the same key sees the same store.
## Subscribe with `Hooks.use_signal_key(key, initial)`.
##
## LIFETIME: the registry is a static (process-global) Dictionary; keyed signals OUTLIVE the
## components that read them — that is the point (shared app state). Call `clear()` on a full
## game/session reset (e.g. returning to the main menu) to drop keyed state; otherwise it persists
## for the process lifetime, matching the Unity reference's lazy-init registry.
##
## EQUALITY: RUISignal change-detection is reference-aware (Object.is): value types by value,
## reference types (Array/Dictionary/Object) by IDENTITY — so set a freshly-built collection to
## notify. In-place mutation of the same reference will NOT notify; pass a per-subscriber `comparer`
## to use_signal_key if you must detect in-place mutation.
