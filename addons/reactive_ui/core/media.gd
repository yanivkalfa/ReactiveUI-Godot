## Fire-and-forget audio for the `use_sfx` hook — the Godot analog of ReactiveUIToolKit's
## MediaHost.SfxSource. Godot's AudioStreamPlayer is a scene node, so persistent audio/video is
## just a host element (V.audio / V.video); only one-shot SFX needs a managed, self-freeing
## player. (No pool: one-shots are infrequent and a self-freeing player is simpler and leak-free.)

## Play `stream` once on a transient AudioStreamPlayer parented to the scene root. The player frees
## itself when the clip finishes. `bus` falls back to "Master" if it doesn't exist; `volume_db` and
## `pitch_scale` shape the one-shot. No-op (safe) when there is no SceneTree or stream.
