extends RefCounted
## Runtime Fast Refresh (Phase H): applies editor-pushed script reloads to the RUNNING game.
##
## The reactive_ui EditorPlugin's watcher compiles `.guitkx` -> sibling `.gd` on save and pushes
## the changed paths into this game over the debugger channel (`rui_hmr:reload`, see
## editor/hmr_debugger.gd). We reload each script IN PLACE -- `source_code` + `reload(true)` on
## the SAME GDScript resource -- so method-reference Callables (`DemoBox.render`) keep their
## identity AND dispatch the new code (H0 spike + godot#85704). Fiber matching is Callable
## equality, so hook state survives for free; the only thing a reload cannot do by itself is
## defeat the reconciler's bailout cache -- RUIReconciler.hmr_refresh_all does that.
##
## Semantics (Unity RefreshRuntime parity):
##   - component script changed        -> targeted: only its fibers re-render (state preserved)
##   - hook/module script changed      -> global: every function fiber re-renders (any component
##                                        may call it -- Unity's TriggerGlobalReRender)
##   - hook SIGNATURE changed (__RUI_HOOK_SIG const, emitted by the compiler since 0.8.0)
##                                     -> that component's state is deliberately RESET
##   - reload failure / empty read     -> per-file isolation: keep old code, report, continue
##
## Inert outside editor runs: registration is gated on EngineDebugger.is_active(), and the
## editor only pushes when a debugger session is attached. Exported builds never see any of it.
