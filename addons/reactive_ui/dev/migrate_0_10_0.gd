## 0.10.0 import-migration runner (SHIPPED with the addon, like dev/migrate_0_9_0.gd): rewrite every
## `.guitkx` in YOUR project to the explicit import model — `export ` on every top-level declaration
## plus one `import { … } from "…"` line per referenced file. Idempotent + re-runnable; hand-written
## `class_name` scripts are ambient and never touched. Run once after updating to 0.10.0:
##   godot --headless --path . --script res://addons/reactive_ui/dev/migrate_0_10_0.gd
## Always migrates the WHOLE project: the import synthesizer needs every `.guitkx` declaration in
## its universe to resolve cross-directory references, so there is deliberately no subtree mode.
